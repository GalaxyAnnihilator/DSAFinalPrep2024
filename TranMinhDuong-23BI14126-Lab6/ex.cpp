/*
A complex number is given in the form:
    z = a + bi
where a is the real part, b is the imaginary part
A size of a complex number is determined by its modulo:
    |z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
Given an array of complex number
a) Sort this array using iteration
b) Sort this array using recursion
c) Sort this array using iteration + linked list
d) Sort this array using recursion + linked list
